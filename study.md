## HTTP Required Reading

HTTP is a protocol - a system of rules - that determines how documents are
transferred from one place to another. Among other things, it defines the format
of the messages passed between *clients* and *servers*.

"Clients" send *requests* and receive *responses*. Examples include browsers
(like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) and other programs like
[`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/) and
[`wget`](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html).

"Servers" receive requests and send responses. Examples are more complex, since
there are different kinds of servers. There are application servers, which work
in Node or Ruby to generate documents using those languages, and there are web
servers like [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), [nginx](http://nginx.com/), and
[lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net). The word "server" is also used to describe
the machine that these programs run on. In this document, the latter is what we
mean when we say "server", as in this diagram:

1.  A client sends a request to a server.
1.  The server processes the request.
1.  The response gets sent back to the client.
1.  The client processes the response.

## URLs

Which server is the request sent to? How does the server know what to respond
with? Both of these questions are answered by *uniform resource locator (URL)*.

Study each part of a URL using the [Mozilla Developer Network
Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL).

## HTTP Verbs

A request has two parts: a URL and a verb. A request without both is incomplete.

By default, the browser issues GET requests when you type a URL into the address
bar and press `enter`. When you submit forms, the browser typically issues a
POST request.

## Make a Request

Make a request using the browser. Go to [Google](https://www.google.com). When
you clicked this link, the browser made a GET request to Google's server. We
often describe requests like this:

```txt
GET https://www.google.com/
```

If we know we're working with a particular server, we might abbreviate
it as follows. For example, if Google had API documentation that described
requests you could make to its server, that documentation might say instead:

```txt
GET /
```

In other words, API docs often only describe the URI instead of the full URL.

The response your browser receives from Google is an HTML document the browser
parses and renders. What would happen if you made the same GET request outside
of the browser?

Try this in your terminal:

```sh
curl --request GET https://www.google.com
```

What did you see?

## Responses & Resources

Servers send responses, and those responses contain resource representations.

Technically, the term "resource" refers to an abstraction that your application
uses; depending on what the application does, a resource might be a 'Car', a
'Person', a 'User', or an 'Order Cart'.

A single resource can be represented in multiple different ways by the server,
including HTML, JSON, PDF files, and images. What we really mean when we say
"resource" above is a specific representation of a resource.

You may think of resources as the documents that are returned (usually HTML or
JSON) as part of the response body.

## Response Statuses

What are HTTP status codes?

## Questions

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Define HTTP

In your own words, give a brief description of what HTTP is.

```md
<!-- HTTP is a text-based protocol that allows messages to be sent back and forth
(almost always initiating with the client that accesses the server via an
IP Address/web address) on the internet.  HTTPS is the secure version. -->
```

## Describe what a client is and what a server is

 What is a client and what is a server? How do they interact with each other?

```md
<!-- A "client" is a personal computer or device.  A server is a different kind
of computer which is used to store data.  some servers are used only for
internal business, but others are web servers and they host websites.  clients
access the servers by typing in their web address -->
```

## Describe the 4 most common HTTP verbs

What are the 4 most common HTTP verbs used when creating a RESTful API. How
would you use each?

```md
<!-- GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.  The GET method instruct the server to send
the data back to the client that has requested access to the website it's
hosting.
POST and PUT seem to be interchangeable.  POST requests submit data and are not
saved cached or saved in the browser's history.  PUT requests are used when you
want to update a resource ID'ed by the URL.  POST and PUT are sometimes used to
create and update operations, too.
DELETE is used when you want to delete the resource ID'ed by the URL. -->
```

## Describe what a Response is

What is a response? What does it contain? What are some common status codes in a
response and what do they mean?

```md
<!-- A response should let the client know the content type of the body.  This
metadata is located in the header.  The response I'm most familiar with is the
404 Not Found (which means the website couldn't be found on the server).
401 means you're not authorized for access, or you need to provide authorization
for access.
500 Internal Server error means there's something wrong with the server. -->
```

## Make a curl request

Using curl, how would you get the content from Reddit.com?

```md
<!-- curl -v Reddit.com -->
```

## Describe the parts of a URL

List the parts of a URL and explain what each part is, in your own words. You'll
refer to this list often in the next few weeks, so it's important to keep it in
an easy-to-reference place.

```md
<!--
"http" is the protocol, which is required and allows for information to be
shared between the client and the server.
"www.website.com" is the domain name.  the domain name was created because it's
easier to remember than an ip address, which is what it represents.
"80/443" are the ports or gates which gives the client access to the web server.
80 is http and 443 is https (secured).  the user generally doesn't see these
numbers, or have to type them in.
"path to the file" looks really similar to the paths we use in CLI, and I think
it's the basically the same thing: it's the path to the resources on the web
server.
"parameters" can do execute different tasks before sending info to the client?
i'm not 100% sure on this one.  sounds like it's just additional info the server
can deliver.
"anchor" is a spot on the website/web document that the user will land on, if
the design has the user end up there.  it could be a video, a submit box, or
what-have-you.
